Kotlin rewrite of the popular mod which adds quake-style movement to minecraft using the fabric mod loader (should be compatible with quilt). May or may not contain additional features, depends on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) and optionally [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

## Build Instructions
1. Clone the git repository
2. Navigate into the cloned directory
3. Run `./gradlew build`

The built jar file will be in `build/libs/`
